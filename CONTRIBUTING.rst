Contributing to ParMOO
======================

Contributions of source code, documentations, and fixes are happily
accepted via GitHub pull request to

    https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo-solver-farm

If you are planning a contribution, reporting bugs, or suggesting features, 
we encourage you to discuss the concept by opening a github issue at

    https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo-solver-farm/issues
  
or by emailing  ``parmoo@mcs.anl.gov``
and interacting with us to ensure that your effort is well-directed.

Contribution Process
--------------------

Since we encourage the inclusion of results with each solver, ParMOO's solver
farm must be protected to prevent overfilling the git history with corrections
to data files. Contributors should typically branch from, and make pull
requests to, the ``main`` branch. Pull requests may be made from a fork.

Issues can be raised at

    https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo-solver-farm/issues

Issues may include reporting bugs or suggested features.

When a branch closes a related issue, the pull request message should include
the phrase "Closes #N," where N is the issue number.

All pull requests to ``main`` must be reviewed by at least one administrator.

*We will typically only approve pull requests for peer-reviewed work to avoid
over-filling the git history.*
